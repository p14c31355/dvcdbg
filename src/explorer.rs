//! # I2C Command Sequence Explorer
//!
//! This module provides an algorithm to discover valid sequences of I2C commands
//! for devices with dependency constraints.
//!
//! ## Overview
//! - `Explorer` holds a sequence of `CmdNode`s, each representing a command and its dependencies.
//! - The `explore` function performs:
//!   1. **Iterative staging**: topological sort-like process to place commands with satisfied dependencies.
//!   2. **Permutation exploration**: non-recursive, linear-stack-based exploration of unresolved commands.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```ignore
//! let cmds = &[
//!     CmdNode { cmd: 0x01, deps: &[] },
//!     CmdNode { cmd: 0x02, deps: &[0x01] },
//!     CmdNode { cmd: 0x03, deps: &[0x01] },
//! ];
//! let explorer = Explorer { sequence: cmds };
//! explorer.explore(&mut i2c, &mut serial).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## AVR / Embedded Constraints
//! - **Stack-safe**: The permutation algorithm is iterative to avoid stack overflow on devices with tiny stacks (e.g., AVR).
//! - **RAM Usage**: `heapless::Vec` is used for `path_stack`, `loop_start_indices`, and `current`, while `current_set` and `used` are fixed-size arrays.
//!   These consume RAM proportional to the number of unresolved commands or the `CMD_CAPACITY` constant. Limit `CMD_CAPACITY` to a safe number (e.g., 8â€“16) for 8-bit MCUs to manage static memory allocation.
//! - **Performance**: Unresolved commands are explored in factorial order (`n!`). Keep unresolved command count low to avoid long execution times.
//! - **Error Handling**: I2C write errors are will be discarded. It is recommended to use scan_init_sequence() first.
//!
//! ## Notes
//! - The algorithm ensures **dependency order is respected**.
//! - Commands are staged and permuted only when dependencies allow.
//! - The non-recursive approach is chosen to make the algorithm safer for small-memory MCUs.
